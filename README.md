# Personal-SOC-Lab-T-Pot-CE-

## Quick Summary

real-life AWS Deployment and Log Analysis using T-POT
I set up an AWS EC2 instance running Linux and installed T-POT CE to build a personal SOC lab. Over seven days, real-world attack telemetry was collected by intentionally exposing 10 containerized honeypots to the public internet (for sole-purpose of SOC analysis and learning.)

This topology represents a public-facing AWS environment specifically designed to collect real-world attack telemetry using containerized honeypots for sole-purpose of SOC analysis and learning.
