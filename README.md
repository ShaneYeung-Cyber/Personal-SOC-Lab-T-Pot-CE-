# Personal-SOC-Lab-T-Pot-CE-

## Quick Summary

I deployed an AWS EC2 instance running Linux and installed T-Pot CE to build a personal SOC lab. Over seven days, real-world attack telemetry was collected by intentionally exposing 10 containerized honeypots to the public internet.

SOC analysis and learning were performed through T-Pot’s web interface, which allowed me to monitor honeypot interactions and attacker behavior. Further analysis and findings are documented throughout this repository.

Overall, this project provided hands-on learning experience through exporting and filtering logs to study specific attacks. I also learned how to distinguish background scan noise from legitimate threats.


## Architecture Topology

![Topology](https://github.com/ShaneYeung-Cyber/Personal-SOC-Lab-T-Pot-CE-/blob/main/Cloud-Based%20Cybersecurity%20Homelab.png)

This topology represents a public-facing AWS environment specifically designed to collect real-world attack telemetry using containerized honeypots for sole-purpose of SOC analysis and learning.
